## 🧠 Code Style Guidelines

To ensure consistency and maintainability, please adhere to these guidelines:

* Use **camelCase** for variables and function names.
* Component files should be **PascalCase**.
* Keep functions modular and reusable.
* Use descriptive variable names.
* Avoid hardcoded values – use constants/configs where possible.

## ✅ PR Review Process

We aim to keep things smooth and transparent:

* Once your PR is submitted, a maintainer will review it.
* You may be asked to:
 * Fix styling issues.
 * Add missing documentation/tests.
 * Break large PRs into smaller pieces.
* After approval:
 * Your PR will be merged with a squash merge to keep history clean.
 * You’ll receive feedback, even if the PR isn’t merged immediately.
* ⌛ Reviews may take **24–72 hours** depending on activity. Thanks for your patience!

## 📝 Contribution Rules

* **One PR per issue** – stay focused and scoped.
* **Don’t start work on an issue unless you’re assigned.**
