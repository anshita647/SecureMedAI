1. Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death in the world and one of the most common endocrine disorders. According to studies, Type 2 diabetes kills thousands of people around the world every year and imposes huge costs on societies in the form of surgeries and other treatment programs, as well as controlling complications and disability. Therefore, predicting and early diagnosis of this disease can greatly help governments and patients.
This dataset is the output of a Chinese research study conducted in 2016. It includes 1304 samples of patients who tested positive for diabetes, and the age of the participants ranges from 21 to 99 years old. The dataset was collected according to the indicators and standards of the World Health Organization, making it a reliable source for building diabetes diagnosis models. Researchers and healthcare professionals can use this dataset to train and test machine learning models to predict and diagnose diabetes in patients. No of records - 4303 (18 cols)

User ID: Unique identifier assigned to each user to ensure data privacy and tracking.
Data: Represents the specific date for each record, indicating the time-series nature of the dataset.
Weight (kg): The user's body weight in kilograms. Weight is a significant factor in determining obesity-related risks.
Height (cm): Height of the user, measured in centimeters. This, combined with weight, helps calculate BMI, a key predictor of diabetes risk.
Blood Glucose (mg/dL): The user's blood glucose level in milligrams per deciliter. This is one of the most crucial indicators for diagnosing diabetes, with values typically ranging between 70 and 300 mg/dL.
Physical Activity (minutes/day): The daily duration of physical activity, measured in minutes. Physical activity plays a critical role in managing blood glucose levels and reducing diabetes risk.
Diet Quality: A categorical variable describing the quality of the user's diet, labeled as either 'healthy' or 'unhealthy'. Diet plays an important role in diabetes prevention and management.
Medication Adherence: Indicates the extent of the user's adherence to prescribed medication, categorized as 'good' or 'poor'. Proper adherence is crucial for managing blood glucose levels effectively.
Stress Level: The stress level reported by the user, categorized as 'low', 'medium', or 'high'. Chronic stress can significantly impact blood glucose levels and contribute to diabetes risk.
Sleep Duration (hours): The number of hours the user sleeps each day. Adequate sleep is vital for maintaining overall health and stabilizing blood sugar levels.
Hydration Status: Indicates whether the user is adequately hydrated, with values of 'yes' or 'no'. Proper hydration supports optimal body function, which includes maintaining blood glucose balance.
BMI: Body Mass Index, calculated using the weight and height of the user. BMI is an important indicator of whether an individual is underweight, of normal weight, overweight, or obese, which is directly linked to diabetes risk.
Risk Score: The calculated risk score for each user, generated based on various health metrics. This score helps categorize users into different risk levels:
-Low Risk (< 30): Users are considered to have a low likelihood of developing diabetes.
-Moderate Risk (30-60): Users are given preventive advice to lower their risk.
-High Risk (> 60): Users are at high risk and receive urgent recommendations to manage their condition.
