# SecureMedAI

SecureMedAI is an AI-powered healthcare web platform that allows patients to predict possible diseases based on symptoms and seamlessly book appointments with specialized doctors. Built with a focus on real-time dashboards, smart doctor matching, and a user-centric experience.

## Overview

SecureMedAI bridges the gap between intelligent diagnosis and timely medical care. Patients receive instant predictions based on symptoms and are connected with top-rated, relevant doctors. Doctors manage appointments and access patient history, while admins oversee the platform.

The platform incorporates machine learning models tailored to user roles:

- **Patients** use a **Random Forest** model for client-side, symptom-based disease prediction.
- **Doctors** utilize **Federated Learning** for privacy-preserving, collaborative diagnosis improvement across distributed data sources.
